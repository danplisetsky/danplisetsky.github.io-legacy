**Two things** I've come to enjoy the most are:

- weaving primitive utf-8 symbols to create manageable and fluent code
- weaving primitive phonetic symbols to create engaging and fluent prose

The former's become a job, the latter a hobby. Both I'm far from being proficient at, but I'm striving to get better every day.

**When it comes to software development**, I'm mainly interested in:

- [pragmatical functional programming][functional-programming]
- reconciling front-end development with the functional approach
- techniques for managing complexity
- technologies that unify development for several platforms by abstracting common functionality (e.g., React Native and Xamarin)

**Born and raised in Russia**, I graduated with a 5-year (MA equivalent) degree in Computer Science. For a year I worked in one of the leading Russian IT companies doing systems analysis.

In 2014 I moved to Israel, where I've been living and working since (including at an English-language media startup as a staff writer and editor). While working as a developer with the Israel Defense Forces, I became interested in functional programming, which started me on a journey of discovering the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) book, which more than any other resource helped me to grasp many of the functional concepts such as recursive processes vs iterative processes in recursive procedures, lambda, closures (both as a property of compound data and higher-order functions) and many more. I've also been teaching myself Clojure on the side.

**Away from the keyboard**, I enjoy reading, contemplating existential philosophical dilemmas (is enjoying the right word for that?), cooking, traveling, and occasionally playing a chess game or two.
