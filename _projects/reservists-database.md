A Windows desktop app written in C# using WPF, MVVM and TDD. It's used to parse a large excel file that changes daily that contains the details of army reservists. Via its GUI the app allows to search for soldiers using several criteria, add them to groups and save the groups for future use (to send them call-up notifications, etc.). It replaced a decade-old web app.
